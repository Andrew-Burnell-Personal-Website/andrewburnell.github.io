            <p>Since high school one of my biggest hobbies has been making movies.
                Storytelling is one of my greatest inspirations and comes in many forms. Being
                behind the camera and seeing my vision take form provides a great sense of accomplishment.
                I work in a very tight crew that I can count on one hand and handle all post production
                duties on my own. I also work within little to no budget allowing for more problem solving
                and creativity.

            <h2>Cosplay</h2>

            <p>Another outlet for my creativity is crafting! I am a huge fan of halloween and a former
                theater kid so that love has translated into cosplay. I mostly work with foam to create
                armor pieces. Construction and design is another outlet of problem solving which translates
                to coding! My favorite property to craft cosplay from is also my favorite movie of all time:
                TRON! Ironically a movie about being sucked into a computer.

            <p>I have been an avid fan of playing video games since I was a young child playing the original NES!
                I am very nostalgic with gaming which led me to eventually modding Game Boy's in my free time! even
                though I'm a sucker for the classics, I also enjoy playing newer games as well with my favorite genre
                being Role Playing games! Gaming is a way for me to decompress so I tend to prefer to play them by
                myself rather than playing matches online.
