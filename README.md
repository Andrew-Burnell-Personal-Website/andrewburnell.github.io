This website was created to foster familiarity with new employers or potential ones. We have the basic index.html as a landing page with my mission statement and a few words that could be used to describe me. The about page goes into more depth about things I like and how they factor into my work ethic and interests. The portfolio page provides examples of previous projects that I have worked on.
